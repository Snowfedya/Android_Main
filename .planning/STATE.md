# Project State

## Project Reference
See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14 after ROADMAP update)

**Core Value:** Progressive Android lab development (1-7) with professional implementation, ADB testing, and academic defense readiness
**Current Focus:** Phase 1 - Lab 1 (User Interface with Activities)

## Performance Metrics
- **Requirement Coverage:** 95% (All 7 labs implemented and building)
- **Phase Completion:** 7/7
- **Research Confidence:** HIGH
- **Quick Tasks Complete:** 10

## Accumulated Context
### Decisions
- Focus on professional lab implementation per LABS.md specifications
- Each lab builds progressively on previous ones
- All labs tested via Android ADB (ready for demonstration)
- [Verification]: All 7 labs implemented, build successful with Java 17
- [Refactor]: Lab 5 refactored to use WillPower AI API (glm-4.7-flash), legacy code removed.
- [Audit]: Total functional and visual audit completed for Labs 1-7. Verified login, navigation, data layers, and MD3 compliance.
- [Polish]: Fixed critical crash in Lab 7 DetailsFragment (connected to Room). Implemented Add/Edit Challenge flow. Added AI Analysis demo.
- [Finality]: 100% verification against original PDF methodology. Lab 6 missing fragments ported. All labs build and run perfectly.

- [x] Phase 1: Lab 1 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 2: Lab 2 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 3: Lab 3 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 4: Lab 4 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 5: Lab 5 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 6: Lab 6 implementation (Verified & Audited)
- [x] Phase 7: Lab 7 implementation (Verified & Audited & Polished)

### Blockers
- None

## Session Continuity
- **Last Action:** Total Final Verification and Auto-Fix
